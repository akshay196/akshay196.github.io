I am part of the RIT India Linux User' Group (an acronym as [RITINLUG](https://ritinlug.org/)) in our college. Our tag-line explains about us, which says "Where Learning is Fun and Sharing is a Learning Methodology" As a student, I am lucky that I use F/OSS for my all activities in college. Because of that, whenever I need, I can see source code of that software. We are the members of lug, loves open source technologies and try to uses these by our own all the time. Everyone works on their own favorite technology and also share their work with ourselves. There are lots of new comers who use to learn open source software and many of them faces difficulties while learning. However there are people in our college, who has better understanding in this. So to fill this gap, We have started Open Source Discussion platform for all. Primary idea behind this to help others while sharing your knowledge with them. This is weekly session, and everyone allowed to participate in this by their own interest.

## First Discussion

First session starts with my mates and juniors. Many of them are unclear about open source. So our discussion starts with open source. We discover about Free software movement in past by Richard Stallman. We understand what the free software means?(Free as in freedom, not free as in beer) Then we talk about [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/) project announced in 1983. Then they used Linux kernel by Linus Torvalds, which was his hobby project. We also discuss about difficulties we face while using proprietary softwares and how they are overcome by using open source tools. We then describe drawbacks of using close source software, like vendor use to spy on us. This destroy our privacy etc. This topics is really interesting for us.

## Ansible

Students gathered there for the session were new to Ansible. So I wanted to take some basics of Ansible, which is the widely used automation tool. Starting from basics, we discuss use case of the Ansible. We saw the functionality as well. We understand concepts like inventory, hosts, modules, playbooks etc. Many of them, comes up with an errors while running ansible commands and executing playbooks. They shared their solution for the errors they get with others, which was the primary reason behind this session.

In this 2 hrs of session, I personally learnt many things. We continue such session in every week for us and for others.
